    Hi, I'm
    <a href="https://github.com/rcoedo" target="_blank" class="yellow">Roman</a
    >.
  </h1>
  <p>
    Welcome to this humble corner of the internet. In here, you will find
    articles and notes that I enjoy sharing with the rest of the world and with
    my future self.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am a full-stack developer who has been writing code professionally for the
    past eight years. I specialize in everything related to JavaScript, Node.js,
    and the React ecosystem. I am also proficient with Java and Spring. Lately,
    I have been working towards becoming a Rust developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy a good discussion, writing about random topics, listening to live
    music, going to the beach, and playing my ukulele.
  </p>
  <p>I am currently based in Galicia, Spain.</p>
