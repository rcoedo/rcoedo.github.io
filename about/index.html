  <h1>Hi, I'm <a href="/about" class="yellow">Roman</a>.</h1>
  <p>
    I am a full-stack developer who has been writing code professionally for the
    past eight years. I specialize in everything related to JavaScript, Node.js,
    and the React ecosystem. I am also proficient with Java and Spring, and
    lately, I have been working towards becoming a Rust developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy a good discussion, writing about random topics, listening to live
    music, going to the beach, and playing my ukulele.
  </p>
  <p>I am currently based in Galicia, Spain.</p>
